1.3.3 (unreleased)
==================

(No changes yet.)

1.3.2 (2010-08-23)
==================

- Bugfix for the change introduced in 1.3.1.

1.3.1 (2010-08-23)
==================

- Support recipes that are using zc.recipe.egg by passing in a dict, rather
  than a zc.buildout.buildout.Options object as was expected/tested.

1.3.0 (2010-08-23)
==================

- Small further refactorings past 1.2.3b1 to be compatible with zc.buildout
  1.5.0.

1.2.3b1 (2010-04-29)
====================

- Refactored to be used with z3c.recipe.scripts and zc.buildout 1.5.0.  No
  new user-visible features.

1.2.2 (2009-03-18)
==================

- Fixed a dependency information. zc.buildout >1.2.0 is required.

1.2.1 (2009-03-18)
==================

- Refactored generation of relative egg paths to generate simpler code.

1.2.0 (2009-03-17)
==================

- Added the `dependent-scripts` option.  When set to `true`, scripts will
  be generated for all required eggs in addition to the eggs named
  specifically.  This idea came from two forks of this recipe,
  `repoze.recipe.egg` and `pylons_sandbox`, but the option name is
  spelled with a dash instead of underscore and it defaults to `false`.

- Added a relative-paths option. When true, egg paths in scripts are generated
  relative to the script names.

1.1.0 (2008-07-19)
==================

- Refactored to work honor the new buildout-level unzip option.


1.1.0b1 (2008-06-27)
====================

- Added `environment` option to custom extension building options.

1.0.0 (2007-11-03)
==================

- No code changes from last beta, just some small package meta-data
  improvements.

1.0.0b5 (2007-02-08)
====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added support for the buildout newest option.

1.0.0b4 (2007-01-17)
====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added initialization and arguments options to the scripts recipe.

- Added an eggs recipe that *just* installes eggs.

- Advertized the scripts recipe for creating scripts.

1.0.0b3 (2006-12-04)
====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added a develop recipe for creating develop eggs.

  This is useful to:

  - Specify custom extension building options,

  - Specify a version of Python to use, and to

  - Cause develop eggs to be created after other parts.

- The develop and build recipes now return the paths created, so that
  created eggs or egg links are removed when a part is removed (or
  changed).


1.0.0b2 (2006-10-16)
====================

Updated to work with (not get a warning from) zc.buildout 1.0.0b10.

1.0.0b1
=======

Updated to work with zc.buildout 1.0.0b3.

1.0.0a3
=======

- Extra path elements to be included in generated scripts can now be
  set via the extra-paths option.

- No longer implicitly generate py\_ scripts fo reach egg. There is
  now an interpreter option to generate a script that, when run
  without arguments, launches the Python interactive interpreter with
  the path set based on a parts eggs and extra paths.  If this script
  is run with the name of a Python script and arguments, then the
  given script is run with the path set.

- You can now specify explicit entry points.  This is useful for use
  with packages that don't declare their own entry points.

- Added Windows support.

- Now-longer implicitly generate "py\_" scripts for each egg.  You can
  now generate a script for launching a Python interpreter or for
  running scripts based on the eggs defined for an egg part.

- You can now specify custom entry points for packages that don't
  declare their entry points.

- You can now specify extra-paths to be included in generated scripts.


1.0.0a2
=======

Added a custom recipe for building custom eggs using custom distrutils
build_ext arguments.

1.0.0a1
=======

Initial public version
