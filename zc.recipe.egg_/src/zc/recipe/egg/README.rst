Installation of distributions as eggs
=====================================

The zc.recipe.egg:eggs recipe can be used to install various types if
distutils distributions as eggs.  It takes a number of options:

eggs
    A list of eggs to install given as one or more setuptools
    requirement strings.  Each string must be given on a separate
    line.

find-links
   A list of URLs, files, or directories to search for distributions.

index
   The URL of an index server, or almost any other valid URL. :)

   If not specified, the Python Package Index,
   http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi, is used.  You can specify an
   alternate index with this option.  If you use the links option and
   if the links point to the needed distributions, then the index can
   be anything and will be largely ignored.  In the examples, here,
   we'll just point to an empty directory on our link server.  This
   will make our examples run a little bit faster.

We have a link server that has a number of distributions:

    >>> print_(get(link_server), end='')
    <html><body>
    <a href="bigdemo-0.1-py2.3.egg">bigdemo-0.1-py2.3.egg</a><br>
    <a href="demo-0.1-py2.3.egg">demo-0.1-py2.3.egg</a><br>
    <a href="demo-0.2-py2.3.egg">demo-0.2-py2.3.egg</a><br>
    <a href="demo-0.3-py2.3.egg">demo-0.3-py2.3.egg</a><br>
    <a href="demo-0.4rc1-py2.3.egg">demo-0.4rc1-py2.3.egg</a><br>
    <a href="demoneeded-1.0.zip">demoneeded-1.0.zip</a><br>
    <a href="demoneeded-1.1.zip">demoneeded-1.1.zip</a><br>
    <a href="demoneeded-1.2rc1.zip">demoneeded-1.2rc1.zip</a><br>
    <a href="du_zipped-1.0-pyN.N.egg">du_zipped-1.0-pyN.N.egg</a><br>
    <a href="extdemo-1.4.zip">extdemo-1.4.zip</a><br>
    <a href="index/">index/</a><br>
    <a href="mixedcase-0.5.zip">mixedcase-0.5.zip</a><br>
    <a href="other-1.0-py2.3.egg">other-1.0-py2.3.egg</a><br>
    </body></html>

We have a sample buildout.  Let's update it's configuration file to
install the demo package.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:eggs
    ... eggs = demo<0.3
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

In this example, we limited ourselves to revisions before 0.3. We also
specified where to find distributions using the find-links option.

Let's run the buildout:

    >>> import os
    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Installing demo.
    Getting distribution for 'demo<0.3'.
    Got demo 0.2.
    Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    Got demoneeded 1.1.

Now, if we look at the buildout eggs directory:

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'eggs')
    d  demo-0.2-py2.3.egg
    d  demoneeded-1.1-py2.3.egg
    -  setuptools-0.7-py2.3.egg
    d  zc.buildout-1.0-py2.3.egg

We see that we got an egg for demo that met the requirement, as well
as the egg for demoneeded, which demo requires.  (We also see an egg
link for the recipe in the develop-eggs directory.  This egg link was
actually created as part of the sample buildout setup. Normally, when
using the recipe, you'll get a regular egg installation.)

Script generation
-----------------

The demo egg defined a script, but we didn't get one installed:

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'bin')
    -  buildout

If we want scripts provided by eggs to be installed, we should use the
scripts recipe:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:scripts
    ... eggs = demo<0.3
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/demo'.

Now we also see the script defined by the demo script:

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'bin')
    -  buildout
    -  demo

The scripts recipe defines some additional options:

entry-points
   A list of entry-point identifiers of the form:

   name=module:attrs

   where name is a script name, module is a dotted name resolving to a
   module name, and attrs is a dotted name resolving to a callable
   object within a module.

   This option is useful when working with distributions that don't
   declare entry points, such as distributions not written to work
   with setuptools.

   Examples can be seen in the section "Specifying entry points" below.

scripts
   Control which scripts are generated.  The value should be a list of
   zero or more tokens.  Each token is either a name, or a name
   followed by an '=' and a new name.  Only the named scripts are
   generated.  If no tokens are given, then script generation is
   disabled.  If the option isn't given at all, then all scripts
   defined by the named eggs will be generated.

dependent-scripts
   If set to the string "true", scripts will be generated for all
   required eggs in addition to the eggs specifically named.

interpreter
   The name of a script to generate that allows access to a Python
   interpreter that has the path set based on the eggs installed.

extra-paths
   Extra paths to include in a generated script.

initialization
   Specify some Python initialization code.  This is very limited.  In
   particular, be aware that leading whitespace is stripped from the
   code given.

arguments
   Specify some arguments to be passed to entry points as Python source.

relative-paths
   If set to true, then egg paths will be generated relative to the
   script path.  This allows a buildout to be moved without breaking
   egg paths.  This option can be set in either the script section or
   in the buildout section.

Let's add an interpreter option:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... eggs = demo<0.3
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... interpreter = py-demo
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

Note that we omitted the entry point name from the recipe
specification. We were able to do this because the scripts recipe is
the default entry point for the zc.recipe.egg egg.

   >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
   Uninstalling demo.
   Installing demo.
   Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/demo'.
   Generated interpreter '/sample-buildout/bin/py-demo'.

Now we also get a py-demo script for giving us a Python prompt with
the path for demo and any eggs it depends on included in sys.path.
This is useful for debugging and testing.

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'bin')
    -  buildout
    -  demo
    -  py-demo

If we run the demo script, it prints out some minimal data:

    >>> print_(system(join(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'demo')), end='')
    2 1

The value it prints out happens to be some values defined in the
modules installed.

We can also run the py-demo script.  Here we'll just print_(out)
the bits if the path added to reflect the eggs:

    >>> print_(system(join(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'py-demo'),
    ... """import os, sys
    ... for p in sys.path:
    ...     if 'demo' in p:
    ...         _ = sys.stdout.write(os.path.basename(p)+'\\n')
    ...
    ... """).replace('>>> ', '').replace('... ', ''), end='')
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    demo-0.2-py2.4.egg
    demoneeded-1.1-py2.4.egg...

Egg updating
------------

The recipe normally gets the most recent distribution that satisfies the
specification.  It won't do this is the buildout is either in
non-newest mode or in offline mode.  To see how this works, we'll
remove the restriction on demo:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

and run the buildout in non-newest mode:

    >>> print_(system(buildout+' -N'), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/demo'.

Note that we removed the eggs option, and the eggs defaulted to the
part name. Because we removed the eggs option, the demo was
reinstalled.

We'll also run the buildout in off-line mode:

    >>> print_(system(buildout+' -o'), end='')
    Updating demo.

We didn't get an update for demo:

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'eggs')
    d  demo-0.2-py2.3.egg
    d  demoneeded-1.1-py2.3.egg
    -  setuptools-0.7-py2.3.egg
    d  zc.buildout-1.0-py2.3.egg

If we run the buildout on the default online and newest modes,
we'll get an update for demo:

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Updating demo.
    Getting distribution for 'demo'.
    Got demo 0.3.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/demo'.

Then we'll get a new demo egg:

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'eggs')
    d  demo-0.2-py2.3.egg
    d  demo-0.3-py2.3.egg
    d  demoneeded-1.1-py2.3.egg
    -  setuptools-0.7-py2.4.egg
    d  zc.buildout-1.0-py2.4.egg

The script is updated too:

    >>> print_(system(join(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'demo')), end='')
    3 1

Controlling script generation
-----------------------------

You can control which scripts get generated using the scripts option.
For example, to suppress scripts, use the scripts option without any
arguments:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... scripts =
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))


    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'bin')
    -  buildout

You can also control the name used for scripts:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... scripts = demo=foo
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/foo'.

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'bin')
    -  buildout
    -  foo

Specifying extra script paths
-----------------------------

If we need to include extra paths in a script, we can use the
extra-paths option:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... scripts = demo=foo
    ... extra-paths =
    ...    /foo/bar
    ...    ${buildout:directory}/spam
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/foo'.

Let's look at the script that was generated:

    >>> cat(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'foo') # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    #!/usr/local/bin/python2.7
    <BLANKLINE>
    import sys
    sys.path[0:0] = [
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demo-0.3-py2.4.egg',
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demoneeded-1.1-py2.4.egg',
      '/foo/bar',
      '/sample-buildout/spam',
      ]
    <BLANKLINE>
    import eggrecipedemo
    <BLANKLINE>
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(eggrecipedemo.main())

Relative egg paths
------------------

If the relative-paths option is specified with a true value, then
paths will be generated relative to the script. This is useful when
you want to be able to move a buildout directory around without
breaking scripts.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... scripts = demo=foo
    ... relative-paths = true
    ... extra-paths =
    ...    /foo/bar
    ...    ${buildout:directory}/spam
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/foo'.

Let's look at the script that was generated:

    >>> cat(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'foo') # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    #!/usr/local/bin/python2.7
    <BLANKLINE>
    import os
    <BLANKLINE>
    join = os.path.join
    base = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(os.path.realpath(__file__)))
    base = os.path.dirname(base)
    <BLANKLINE>
    import sys
    sys.path[0:0] = [
      join(base, 'eggs/demo-0.3-pyN.N.egg'),
      join(base, 'eggs/demoneeded-1.1-pyN.N.egg'),
      '/foo/bar',
      join(base, 'spam'),
      ]
    <BLANKLINE>
    import eggrecipedemo
    <BLANKLINE>
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(eggrecipedemo.main())

You can specify relative paths in the buildout section, rather than in
each individual script section:


    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ... relative-paths = true
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... scripts = demo=foo
    ... extra-paths =
    ...    /foo/bar
    ...    ${buildout:directory}/spam
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/foo'.

    >>> cat(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'foo') # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    #!/usr/local/bin/python2.7
    <BLANKLINE>
    import os
    <BLANKLINE>
    join = os.path.join
    base = os.path.dirname(os.path.abspath(os.path.realpath(__file__)))
    base = os.path.dirname(base)
    <BLANKLINE>
    import sys
    sys.path[0:0] = [
      join(base, 'eggs/demo-0.3-pyN.N.egg'),
      join(base, 'eggs/demoneeded-1.1-pyN.N.egg'),
      '/foo/bar',
      join(base, 'spam'),
      ]
    <BLANKLINE>
    import eggrecipedemo
    <BLANKLINE>
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(eggrecipedemo.main())

Specifying initialization code and arguments
-----------------------------------------------

Sometimes, we need to do more than just calling entry points.  We can
use the initialization and arguments options to specify extra code
to be included in generated scripts:


    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... scripts = demo=foo
    ... extra-paths =
    ...    /foo/bar
    ...    ${buildout:directory}/spam
    ... initialization = a = (1, 2
    ...                       3, 4)
    ... interpreter = py
    ... arguments = a, 2
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/foo'.
    Generated interpreter '/sample-buildout/bin/py'.

    >>> cat(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'foo') # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE
    #!/usr/local/bin/python2.7
    <BLANKLINE>
    import sys
    sys.path[0:0] = [
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demo-0.3-py2.4.egg',
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demoneeded-1.1-py2.4.egg',
      '/foo/bar',
      '/sample-buildout/spam',
      ]
    <BLANKLINE>
    a = (1, 2
    3, 4)
    <BLANKLINE>
    import eggrecipedemo
    <BLANKLINE>
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(eggrecipedemo.main(a, 2))

Here we see that the initialization code we specified was added after
setting the path.  Note, as mentioned above, that leading whitespace
has been stripped.  Similarly, the argument code we specified was
added in the entry point call (to main).

Our interpreter also has the initialization code:

    >>> cat(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'py')
    ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS
    #!/usr/local/bin/python2.7
    <BLANKLINE>
    import sys
    <BLANKLINE>
    sys.path[0:0] = [
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demo-0.3-py3.3.egg',
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demoneeded-1.1-py3.3.egg',
      '/foo/bar',
      '/sample-buildout/spam',
      ]
    <BLANKLINE>
    a = (1, 2
    3, 4)
    <BLANKLINE>
    <BLANKLINE>
    _interactive = True
    ...

Specifying entry points
-----------------------

Scripts can be generated for entry points declared explicitly.  We can
declare entry points using the entry-points option:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... extra-paths =
    ...    /foo/bar
    ...    ${buildout:directory}/spam
    ... entry-points = alt=eggrecipedemo:alt other=foo.bar:a.b.c
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/demo'.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/alt'.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/other'.

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'bin')
    -  alt
    -  buildout
    -  demo
    -  other

    >>> cat(sample_buildout, 'bin', 'other')
    #!/usr/local/bin/python2.7
    <BLANKLINE>
    import sys
    sys.path[0:0] = [
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demo-0.3-py2.4.egg',
      '/sample-buildout/eggs/demoneeded-1.1-py2.4.egg',
      '/foo/bar',
      '/sample-buildout/spam',
      ]
    <BLANKLINE>
    import foo.bar
    <BLANKLINE>
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        sys.exit(foo.bar.a.b.c())

Generating all scripts
----------------------

The `bigdemo` package doesn't have any scripts, but it requires the `demo`
package, which does have a script.  Specify `dependent-scripts = true` to
generate all scripts in required packages:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = bigdemo
    ...
    ... [bigdemo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... dependent-scripts = true
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))
    >>> print_(system(buildout+' -N'), end='')
    Uninstalling demo.
    Installing bigdemo.
    Getting distribution for 'bigdemo'.
    Got bigdemo 0.1.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/demo'.

Offline mode
------------

If the buildout offline option is set to "true", then no attempt will
be made to contact an index server:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = demo
    ... offline = true
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... index = eek!
    ... scripts = demo=foo
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Uninstalling bigdemo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/foo'.
