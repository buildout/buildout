Creating eggs with extensions needing custom build settings
=============================================================

Sometimes, It's necessary to provide extra control over how an egg is
created.  This is commonly true for eggs with extension modules that
need to access libraries or include files.

The zc.recipe.egg:custom recipe can be used to define an egg with
custom build parameters.  The currently defined parameters are:

include-dirs
   A new-line separated list of directories to search for include
   files.

library-dirs
   A new-line separated list of directories to search for libraries
   to link with.

rpath
   A new-line separated list of directories to search for dynamic libraries
   at run time.

define
   A comma-separated list of names of C preprocessor variables to
   define.

undef
   A comma-separated list of names of C preprocessor variables to
   undefine.

libraries
   The name of an additional library to link with.  Due to limitations
   in distutils and despite the option name, only a single library
   can be specified.

link-objects
   The name of an link object to link against.  Due to limitations
   in distutils and despite the option name, only a single link object
   can be specified.

debug
   Compile/link with debugging information

force
   Forcibly build everything (ignore file timestamps)

compiler
   Specify the compiler type

swig
   The path to the swig executable

swig-cpp
   Make SWIG create C++ files (default is C)

swig-opts
   List of SWIG command line options

In addition, the following options can be used to specify the egg:

egg
    An specification for the egg to be created, to install given as a
    setuptools requirement string.  This defaults to the part name.

find-links
   A list of URLs, files, or directories to search for distributions.

index
   The URL of an index server, or almost any other valid URL. :)

   If not specified, the Python Package Index,
   http://cheeseshop.python.org/pypi, is used.  You can specify an
   alternate index with this option.  If you use the links option and
   if the links point to the needed distributions, then the index can
   be anything and will be largely ignored.  In the examples, here,
   we'll just point to an empty directory on our link server.  This
   will make our examples run a little bit faster.

environment
   The name of a section with additional environment variables. The
   environment variables are set before the egg is built.

To illustrate this, we'll define a buildout that builds an egg for a
package that has a simple extension module::

  #include <Python.h>
  #include <extdemo.h>

  static PyMethodDef methods[] = {};

  PyMODINIT_FUNC
  initextdemo(void)
  {
      PyObject *m;
      m = Py_InitModule3("extdemo", methods, "");
  #ifdef TWO
      PyModule_AddObject(m, "val", PyInt_FromLong(2));
  #else
      PyModule_AddObject(m, "val", PyInt_FromLong(EXTDEMO));
  #endif
  }

The extension depends on a system-dependent include file, extdemo.h,
that defines a constant, EXTDEMO, that is exposed by the extension.

The extension module is available as a source distribution,
extdemo-1.4.tar.gz, on a distribution server.

We have a sample buildout that we'll add an include directory to with
the necessary include file:

    >>> mkdir('include')
    >>> write('include', 'extdemo.h',
    ... """
    ... #define EXTDEMO 42
    ... """)

We'll also update the buildout configuration file to define a part for
the egg:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... parts = extdemo
    ...
    ... [extdemo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:custom
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... include-dirs = include
    ...
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Installing extdemo...

We got the zip_safe warning because the source distribution we used
wasn't setuptools based and thus didn't set the option.

The egg is created in the develop-eggs directory *not* the eggs
directory because it depends on buildout-specific parameters and the
eggs directory can be shared across multiple buildouts.

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'develop-eggs')
    d  extdemo-1.4-py2.4-unix-i686.egg
    -  zc.recipe.egg.egg-link

Note that no scripts or dependencies are installed.  To install
dependencies or scripts for a custom egg, define another part and use
the zc.recipe.egg recipe, listing the custom egg as one of the eggs to
be installed.  The zc.recipe.egg recipe will use the installed egg.

Let's define a script that uses out ext demo:

    >>> mkdir('demo')
    >>> write('demo', 'demo.py',
    ... """
    ... import extdemo, sys
    ... def print_(*args):
    ...     sys.stdout.write(' '.join(map(str, args)) + '\\n')
    ... def main():
    ...     print_(extdemo.val)
    ... """)

    >>> write('demo', 'setup.py',
    ... """
    ... from setuptools import setup
    ... setup(name='demo')
    ... """)


    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = demo
    ... parts = extdemo demo
    ...
    ... [extdemo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:custom
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... include-dirs = include
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... eggs = demo
    ...        extdemo
    ... entry-points = demo=demo:main
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/demo'
    Updating extdemo.
    Installing demo.
    Generated script '/sample-buildout/bin/demo'.

When we run the script, we'll 42 printed:

    >>> print_(system(join('bin', 'demo')), end='')
    42

Updating
--------

The custom recipe will normally check for new source distributions
that meet the given specification.  This can be suppressed using the
buildout non-newest and offline modes.  We'll generate a new source
distribution for extdemo:

    >>> update_extdemo()

If we run the buildout in non-newest or offline modes:

    >>> print_(system(buildout+' -N'), end='')
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/demo'
    Updating extdemo.
    Updating demo.

    >>> print_(system(buildout+' -o'), end='')
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/demo'
    Updating extdemo.
    Updating demo.

We won't get an update.

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'develop-eggs')
    -  demo.egg-link
    d  extdemo-1.4-py2.4-unix-i686.egg
    -  zc.recipe.egg.egg-link

But if we run the buildout in the default on-line and newest modes, we
will. This time we also get the test-variable message again, because the new
version is imported:

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/demo'
    Updating extdemo.
    zip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...
    Updating demo.
    ...

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'develop-eggs')
    -  demo.egg-link
    d  extdemo-1.4-py2.4-linux-i686.egg
    d  extdemo-1.5-py2.4-linux-i686.egg
    -  zc.recipe.egg.egg-link

Controlling the version used
----------------------------

We can specify a specific version using the egg option:

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = demo
    ... parts = extdemo demo
    ...
    ... [extdemo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:custom
    ... egg = extdemo ==1.4
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... include-dirs = include
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... eggs = demo
    ...        extdemo ==1.4
    ... entry-points = demo=demo:main
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))

    >>> print_(system(buildout+' -D'), end='') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/demo'
    ...

    >>> ls(sample_buildout, 'develop-eggs')
    -  demo.egg-link
    d  extdemo-1.4-py2.4-linux-i686.egg
    -  zc.recipe.egg.egg-link


Controlling environment variables
+++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++++

To set additional environment variables, the `environment` option is used.

Let's create a recipe which prints out environment variables. We need this to
make sure the set environment variables are removed after the egg:custom
recipe was run.

    >>> mkdir(sample_buildout, 'recipes')
    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'recipes', 'environ.py',
    ... """
    ... import logging, os, zc.buildout
    ...
    ... class Environ:
    ...
    ...     def __init__(self, buildout, name, options):
    ...         self.name = name
    ...
    ...     def install(self):
    ...         logging.getLogger(self.name).info(
    ...             'test-variable left over: %s' % (
    ...                 'test-variable' in os.environ))
    ...         return []
    ...
    ...     def update(self):
    ...         self.install()
    ... """)
    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'recipes', 'setup.py',
    ... """
    ... from setuptools import setup
    ...
    ... setup(
    ...     name = "recipes",
    ...     entry_points = {'zc.buildout': ['environ = environ:Environ']},
    ...     )
    ... """)


Create our buildout:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = recipes
    ... parts = extdemo checkenv
    ...
    ... [extdemo-env]
    ... test-variable = foo
    ...
    ... [extdemo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:custom
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... include-dirs = include
    ... environment = extdemo-env
    ...
    ... [checkenv]
    ... recipe = recipes:environ
    ...
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))
    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/recipes'
    Uninstalling demo.
    Uninstalling extdemo.
    Installing extdemo.
    Have environment test-variable: foo
    zip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...
    Installing checkenv.
    ...


The setup.py also printed out that we have set the environment `test-variable`
to foo. After the buildout the variable is reset to its original value (i.e.
removed).

When an environment variable has a value before zc.recipe.egg:custom is run,
the original value will be restored:

    >>> import os
    >>> os.environ['test-variable'] = 'bar'
    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='')
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/recipes'
    Updating extdemo.
    Updating checkenv.
    checkenv: test-variable left over: True

    >>> os.environ['test-variable']
    'bar'


Sometimes it is required to prepend or append to an existing environment
variable, for instance for adding something to the PATH. Therefore all variables
are interpolated with os.environ before the're set:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = recipes
    ... parts = extdemo checkenv
    ...
    ... [extdemo-env]
    ... test-variable = foo:%%(test-variable)s
    ...
    ... [extdemo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:custom
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... include-dirs = include
    ... environment = extdemo-env
    ...
    ... [checkenv]
    ... recipe = recipes:environ
    ...
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))
    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/recipes'
    Uninstalling extdemo.
    Installing extdemo.
    Have environment test-variable: foo:bar
    zip_safe flag not set; analyzing archive contents...
    Updating checkenv.
    ...

    >>> os.environ['test-variable']
    'bar'
    >>> del os.environ['test-variable']


Create a clean buildout.cfg w/o the checkenv recipe, and delete the recipe:

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = recipes
    ... parts = extdemo
    ...
    ... [extdemo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:custom
    ... find-links = %(server)s
    ... index = %(server)s/index
    ... include-dirs = include
    ...
    ... """ % dict(server=link_server))
    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/recipes'
    Uninstalling checkenv.
    Uninstalling extdemo.
    Installing extdemo...

    >>> rmdir(sample_buildout, 'recipes')


Controlling develop-egg generation
==================================

If you want to provide custom build options for a develop egg, you can
use the develop recipe.  The recipe has the following options:

setup
   The path to a setup script or directory containing a startup
   script. This is required.

include-dirs
   A new-line separated list of directories to search for include
   files.

library-dirs
   A new-line separated list of directories to search for libraries
   to link with.

rpath
   A new-line separated list of directories to search for dynamic libraries
   at run time.

define
   A comma-separated list of names of C preprocessor variables to
   define.

undef
   A comma-separated list of names of C preprocessor variables to
   undefine.

libraries
   The name of an additional library to link with.  Due to limitations
   in distutils and despite the option name, only a single library
   can be specified.

link-objects
   The name of an link object to link against.  Due to limitations
   in distutils and despite the option name, only a single link object
   can be specified.

debug
   Compile/link with debugging information

force
   Forcibly build everything (ignore file timestamps)

compiler
   Specify the compiler type

swig
   The path to the swig executable

swig-cpp
   Make SWIG create C++ files (default is C)

swig-opts
   List of SWIG command line options

To illustrate this, we'll use a directory containing the extdemo
example from the earlier section:

    >>> ls(extdemo)
    -  MANIFEST
    -  MANIFEST.in
    -  README
    -  extdemo.c
    -  setup.py

    >>> write('buildout.cfg',
    ... """
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = demo
    ... parts = extdemo demo
    ...
    ... [extdemo]
    ... setup = %(extdemo)s
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:develop
    ... include-dirs = include
    ... define = TWO
    ...
    ... [demo]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg
    ... eggs = demo
    ...        extdemo
    ... entry-points = demo=demo:main
    ... """ % dict(extdemo=extdemo))

Note that we added a define option to cause the preprocessor variable
TWO to be defined.  This will cause the module-variable, 'val', to be
set with a value of 2.

    >>> print_(system(buildout), end='') # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/demo'
    Uninstalling extdemo.
    Installing extdemo.
    Installing demo.
    ...

Our develop-eggs now includes an egg link for extdemo:

    >>> ls('develop-eggs')
    -  demo.egg-link
    -  extdemo.egg-link
    -  zc.recipe.egg.egg-link

and the extdemo now has a built extension:

    >>> contents = os.listdir(extdemo)
    >>> bool([f for f in contents if f.endswith('.so') or f.endswith('.pyd')])
    True

Because develop eggs take precedence over non-develop eggs, the demo
script will use the new develop egg:

    >>> print_(system(join('bin', 'demo')), end='')
    2
