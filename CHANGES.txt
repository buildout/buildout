The buildout system is under active development. Some near term
priorities include:

- Fixing `bugs <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bugs>`_

- Adding support for making distributions from buildouts

Change History
**************

1.0.0b23 (2007-03-??)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added support for download caches.  A buildout can specify a cache
  for distribution downloads.  The cache can be shared among buildouts
  to reduce network access and to support creating source
  distributions for applications allowing install without network
  access. 

Bugs Fixed
----------

- It wasn't possible to give options on the command line for sections
  not defined in a configuration file.

1.0.0b22 (2007-03-15)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Improved error reporting and debugging support:

  - Added "logical tracebacks" that show functionally what the buildout
    was doing when an error occurs.  Don't show a Python traceback
    unless the -D option is used.

  - Added a -D option that causes the buildout to print a traceback and
    start the pdb post-mortem debugger when an error occurs.

  - Warnings are printed for unused options in the buildout section and
    installed-part sections.  This should make it easier to catch option
    misspellings.

- Changed the way the installed database (.installed.cfg) is handled
  to avoid database corruption when a user breaks out of a buildout
  with control-c.

- Don't save an installed database if there are no installed parts or
  develop egg links.

1.0.0b21 (2007-03-06)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added support for repeatable buildouts by allowing egg versions to
  be specified in a versions section.

- The easy_install module install and build functions now accept a
  versions argument that supplied to mapping from project name to
  version numbers.  This can be used to fix version numbers for
  required distributions and their depenencies.

  When a version isn't fixed, using either a versions option or using
  a fixed version number in a requirement, then a debug log message is
  emitted indicating the version picked.  This is useful for setting
  versions options.

  A default_versions function can be used to set a default value for
  this option.

- Adjusted the output for verbosity levels.  Using a single -v option
  no longer causes voluminous setuptools output.  Uisng -vv and -vvv
  now triggers extra setuptools output.

- Added a remove testing helper function that removes files or directories.

1.0.0b20 (2007-02-08)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added a buildout newest option, to control whether the newest
  distributions should be sought to meet requirements.  This might
  also provide a hint to recipes that don't deal with
  distributions. For example, a recipe that manages subversion
  checkouts might not update a checkout if newest is set to "false".

- Added a *newest* keyword parameter to the
  zc.buildout.easy_install.install and zc.buildout.easy_install.build
  functions to control whether the newest distributions that meed
  given requirements should be sought.  If a false value is provided
  for this parameter and already installed eggs meet the given
  requirements, then no attempt will be made to search for newer
  distributions.
 
- The recipe-testing support setUp function now adds the name
  *buildout* to the test namespace with a value that is the path to
  the buildout script in the sample buildout.  This allows tests to
  use

    >>> print system(buildout),

  rather than:

    >>> print system(join('bin', 'buildout')),


Bugs Fixed
----------

- Paths returned from update methods replaced lists of installed files
  rather than augmenting them.

1.0.0b19 (2007-01-24)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Explicitly specifying a Python executable failed if the output of
  running Python with the -V option included a 2-digit (rather than a
  3-digit) version number.

1.0.0b18 (2007-01-22)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added documentation for some previously undocumented features of the 
  easy_install APIs.

- By popular demand, added a -o command-line option that is a short
  hand for the assignment buildout:offline=true.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- When deciding whether recipe develop eggs had changed, buildout
  incorrectly considered files in .svn and CVS directories.

1.0.0b17 (2006-12-07)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Configuration files can now be loaded from URLs.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- https://bugs.launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/71246

  Buildout extensions installed as eggs couldn't be loaded in offline
  mode.


1.0.0b16 (2006-12-07)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- A new command-line argument, -U, suppresses reading user defaults.

- You can now suppress use of an installed-part database
  (e.g. .installed.cfg) by sprifying an empty value for the buildout
  installed option.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- When the install command is used with a list of parts, only
  those parts are supposed to be installed, but the buildout was also
  building parts that those parts depended on.

1.0.0b15 (2006-12-06)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Uninstall recipes weren't loaded correctly in cases where
  no parts in the (new) configuration used the recipe egg.

1.0.0b14 (2006-12-05)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added uninstall recipes for dealing with complex uninstallation
  scenarios.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Automatic upgrades weren't performed on Windows due to a bug that
  caused buildout to incorrectly determine that it wasn't running
  locally in a buildout.

- Fixed some spurious test failures on Windows.

1.0.0b13 (2006-12-04)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Variable substitutions now reflect option data written by recipes.

- A part referenced by a part in a parts list is now added to the parts
  list before the referencing part.  This means that you can omit
  parts from the parts list if they are referenced by other parts.

- Added a develop function to the easy_install module to aid in
  creating develop eggs with custom build_ext options.

- The build and develop functions in the easy_install module now
  return the path of the egg or egg link created.

- Removed the limitation that parts named in the install command can
  only name configured parts.

- Removed support ConfigParser-style variable substitutions
  (e.g. %(foo)s). Only the string-template style of variable
  (e.g. ${section:option}) substitutions will be supported.
  Supporting both violates "there's only one way to do it".

- Deprecated the buildout-section extendedBy option.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- We treat setuptools as a dependency of any distribution that
  (declares that it) uses namespace packages, whether it declares
  setuptools as a dependency or not.  This wasn't working for eggs
  intalled by virtue of being dependencies.


1.0.0b12 (2006-10-24)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added an initialization argument to the
  zc.buildout.easy_install.scripts function to include initialization
  code in generated scripts.

1.0.0b11 (2006-10-24)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

`67737 <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/67737>`_
     Verbose and quite output options caused errors when the 
     develop buildout option was used to create develop eggs.

`67871 <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/67871>`_
     Installation failed if the source was a (local) unzipped
     egg.

`67873 <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/67873>`_
     There was an error in producing an error message when part names
     passed to the install command weren't included in the
     configuration. 

1.0.0b10 (2006-10-16)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Renamed the runsetup command to setup. (The old name still works.)

- Added a recipe update method. Now install is only called when a part
  is installed for the first time, or after an uninstall. Otherwise, 
  update is called.  For backward compatibility, recipes that don't
  define update methiods are still supported.

- If a distribution defines namespace packages but fails to declare 
  setuptools as one of its dependencies, we now treat setuptools as an 
  implicit dependency.  We generate a warning if the distribution
  is a develop egg.

- You can now create develop eggs for setup scripts that don't use setuptools.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Egg links weren't removed when corresponding entries were removed
  from develop sections.

- Running a non-local buildout command (one not installed in the
  buildout) ket to a hang if there were new versions of zc.buildout or
  setuptools were available.  Now we issue a warning and don't
  upgrade.

- When installing zip-safe eggs from local directories, the eggs were
  moved, rather than copied, removing them from the source directory.

1.0.0b9 (2006-10-02)
====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

Non-zip-safe eggs were not unzipped when they were installed.

1.0.0b8 (2006-10-01)
====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Installing source distributions failed when using alternate Python
  versions (depending on the versions of Python used.)

- Installing eggs wasn't handled as efficiently as possible due to a
  bug in egg URL parsing.

- Fixed a bug in runsetup that caused setup scripts that introspected
  __file__ to fail.

1.0.0b7
=======

Added a documented testing framework for use by recipes. Refactored
the buildout tests to use it.

Added a runsetup command run a setup script.  This is handy if, like
me, you don't install setuptools in your system Python.

1.0.0b6
=======

Fixed https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/60582
Use of extension options caused bootstrapping to fail if the eggs
directory didn't already exist.  We no longer use extensions for
bootstrapping.  There really isn't any reason to anyway.


1.0.0b5
=======

Refactored to do more work in buildout and less work in easy_install.
This makes things go a little faster, makes errors a little easier to
handle, and allows extensions (like the sftp extension) to influence
more of the process. This was done to fix a problem in using the sftp
support.

1.0.0b4
=======

- Added an **experimental** extensions mechanism, mainly to support
  adding sftp support to buildouts that need it.

- Fixed buildout self-updating on Windows.

1.0.0b3
=======

- Added a help option (-h, --help)

- Increased the default level of verbosity.

- Buildouts now automatically update themselves to new versions of
  zc.buildout and setuptools.

- Added Windows support.

- Added a recipe API for generating user errors.

- No-longer generate a py_zc.buildout script.

- Fixed some bugs in variable substitutions.  

  The characters "-", "." and " ", weren't allowed in section or
  option names.

  Substitutions with invalid names were ignored, which caused
  missleading failures downstream.

- Improved error handling.  No longer show tracebacks for user errors.

- Now require a recipe option (and therefore a section) for every part.

- Expanded the easy_install module API to:

  - Allow extra paths to be provided

  - Specify explicit entry points

  - Specify entry-point arguments

1.0.0b2
=======

Added support for specifying some build_ext options when installing eggs
from source distributions.

1.0.0b1
=======

- Changed the bootstrapping code to only install setuptools and
  zc.buildout. The bootstrap code no-longer runs the buildout itself.
  This was to fix a bug that caused parts to be recreated
  unnecessarily because the recipe signature in the initial buildout
  reflected temporary locations for setuptools and zc.buildout.

- Now create a minimal setup.py if it doesn't exist and issue a
  warning that it is being created.

- Fixed bug in saving installed configuration data.  %'s and extra
  spaces weren't quoted.

1.0.0a1
=======

Initial public version
