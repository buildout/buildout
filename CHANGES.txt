Change History
**************

1.6.0 (2012-08-15)
==================

- The buildout init command now accepts distribution requirements and
  paths to set up a custom interpreter part that has the distributions
  or parts in the path. For example::

     python bootstrap.py init BeautifulSoup

- Introduce a cache for the expensive `buildout._dir_hash` function.

- Remove duplicate path from script's sys.path setup.

- changed broken dash S check to pass the configuration options
  -S -c separately, to make zc.buildout more compatible with the PyPy
  interpreter, which has less flexible argument parsing than CPython.

  Note that PyPy post 1.4.0 is needed to make buildout work at all,
  due to missing support for the ``-E`` option, which only got added
  afterwards.

- Made sure to download extended configuration files only once per buildout
  run even if they are referenced multiple times (patch by Rafael Monnerat).

- Ported speedup optimization patch by Ross Patterson to 1.5.x series.
  Improved patch to calculate required_by packages in linear time
  in verbose mode (-v). Running relatively simple Buildout envornment
  yielded in running time improvement from 30 seconds to 10 seconds.
  (Domen Kožar, Ross Patterson)

- Removed unnecessary pyc recompilation with optimization flags. Running
  Buildout with pre-downloaded ~300 packages that were installed in empty
  eggs repository yielded in running time improvement from 1126 seconds
  to 348 seconds. (Domen Kožar)

Bugs fixed:

- In the download module, fixed the handling of directories that are pointed
  to by file-system paths and ``file:`` URLs.

- Removed any traces of the implementation of ``extended-by``. Raise a
  UserError if the option is encountered instead of ignoring it, though.

- https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/697913 : Buildout doesn't honor exit code
  from scripts. Fixed.

- Handle both addition and subtraction of elements (+= and -=) on the same key
  in the same section.

1.5.2 (2010-10-11)
==================

- changed metadata 'url' to pypi.python.org in order to solve
  a temporary outage of buildout.org

- IMPORTANT: For better backwards compatibility with the pre-1.5 line,
  this release has two big changes from 1.5.0 and 1.5.1.

  - Buildout defaults to including site packages.

  - Buildout loads recipes and extensions with the same constraints to
    site-packages that it builds eggs, instead of never allowing access
    to site-packages.

  This means that the default configuration should better support
  pre-existing use of system Python in recipes or builds.

- To make it easier to detect the fact that buildout has set the PYTHONPATH,
  BUILDOUT_ORIGINAL_PYTHONPATH is always set in the environment, even if
  PYTHONPATH was not originally set.  BUILDOUT_ORIGINAL_PYTHONPATH will
  be an empty string if PYTHONPATH was not set.

1.5.1 (2010-08-29)
==================

New features:

- Scripts store the old PYTHONPATH in BUILDOUT_ORIGINAL_PYTHONPATH if it
  existed, and store nothing in the value if it did not exist.  This allows
  code that does not want subprocesses to have the system-Python-protected
  site.py to set the environment of the subprocess as it was originally.

Bugs fixed:

- https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/623590 : If include-site-packages were
  true and versions were not set explicitly, system eggs were preferred
  over newer released eggs.  Fixed.

1.5.0 (2010-08-23)
==================

New features:

- zc.buildout supports Python 2.7.

- By default, Buildout and the bootstrap script now prefer final versions of
  Buildout, recipes, and extensions.  This can be changed by using the
  --accept-buildout-test-releases flag (or -t for short) when calling
  bootstrap.  This will hopefully allow beta releases of these items to
  be more easily and safely made in the future.

  NOTE: dependencies of your own software are not affected by this new
  behavior. Buildout continues to choose the newest available versions
  of your dependencies regardless of whether they are final releases. To
  prevent this, use the pre-existing switch ``prefer-final = true`` in
  the [buildout] section of your configuration file (see
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout#preferring-final-releases) or
  pin your versions using a versions section (see
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi/zc.buildout#repeatable-buildouts-controlling-eggs-used).

Bugs fixed:

- You can now again use virtualenv with Buildout.  The new features to let
  buildout be used with a system Python are disabled in this configuration,
  and the previous script generation behavior (1.4.3) is used, even if
  the new function ``zc.buildout.easy_install.sitepackage_safe_scripts``
  is used.

1.5.0b2 (2010-04-29)
====================

This was a re-release of 1.4.3 in order to keep 1.5.0b1 release from hurting
workflows that combined virtualenv with zc.buildout.

1.5.0b1 (2010-04-29)
====================

New Features:

- Added buildout:socket-timout option so that socket timeout can be configured
  both from command line and from config files. (gotcha)

- Buildout can be safely used with a system Python (or any Python with code
  in site-packages), as long as you use (1) A fresh checkout, (2) the
  new bootstrap.py, and (3) recipes that use the new
  ``zc.buildout.easy_install.sitepackage_safe_scripts`` function to generate
  scripts and interpreters.  Many recipes will need to be updated to use
  this new function.  The scripts and interpreters generated by
  ``zc.recipe.egg`` will continue to use the older function, not safe
  with system Pythons.  Use the ``z3c.recipe.scripts`` as a replacement.

  zc.recipe.egg is still a fully supported, and simpler, way of
  generating scripts and interpreters if you are using a "clean" Python,
  without code installed in site-packages. It keeps its previous behavior in
  order to provide backwards compatibility.

  The z3c.recipe.scripts recipe allows you to control how you use the
  code in site-packages.  You can exclude it entirely (preferred); allow
  eggs in it to fulfill package dependencies declared in setup.py and
  buildout configuration; allow it to be available but not used to
  fulfill dependencies declared in setup.py or buildout configuration;
  or only allow certain eggs in site-packages to fulfill dependencies.

- Added new function, ``zc.buildout.easy_install.sitepackage_safe_scripts``,
  to generate scripts and interpreter.  It produces a full-featured
  interpreter (all command-line options supported) and the ability to
  safely let scripts include site packages, such as with a system
  Python.  The ``z3c.recipe.scripts`` recipe uses this new function.

- Improve bootstrap.

  * New options let you specify where to find ez_setup.py and where to find
    a download cache.  These options can keep bootstrap from going over the
    network.

  * Another new option lets you specify where to put generated eggs.

  * The buildout script generated by bootstrap honors more of the settings
    in the designated configuration file (e.g., buildout.cfg).

  * Correctly handle systems where pkg_resources is present but the rest of
    setuptools is missing (like Ubuntu installs).
    https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/410528

- You can develop zc.buildout using Distribute instead of Setuptools.  Use
  the --distribute option on the dev.py script.  (Releases should be tested
  with both Distribute and Setuptools.)  The tests for zc.buildout pass
  with Setuptools and Python 2.4, 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7; and with Distribute and
  Python 2.5, 2.6, and 2.7.  Using zc.buildout with Distribute and Python 2.4
  is not recommended.

- The ``distribute-version`` now works in the [buildout] section, mirroring
  the ``setuptools-version`` option (this is for consistency; using the
  general-purpose ``versions`` option is preferred).

Bugs fixed:

- Using Distribute with the ``allow-picked-versions = false`` buildout
  option no longer causes an error.

- The handling and documenting of default buildout options was normalized.
  This means, among other things, that ``bin/buildout -vv`` and
  ``bin/buildout annotate`` correctly list more of the options.

- Installing a namespace package using a Python that already has a package
  in the same namespace (e.g., in the Python's site-packages) failed in
  some cases.  It is now handled correctly.

- Another variation of this error showed itself when at least two
  dependencies were in a shared location like site-packages, and the
  first one met the "versions" setting.  The first dependency would be
  added, but subsequent dependencies from the same location (e.g.,
  site-packages) would use the version of the package found in the
  shared location, ignoring the version setting.  This is also now
  handled correctly.

1.4.3 (2009-12-10)
==================

Bugs fixed:

- Using pre-detected setuptools version for easy_installing tgz files.  This
  prevents a recursion error when easy_installing an upgraded "distribute"
  tgz.  Note that setuptools did not have this recursion problem solely
  because it was packaged as an ``.egg``, which does not have to go through
  the easy_install step.


1.4.2 (2009-11-01)
==================

New Feature:

- Added a --distribute option to the bootstrap script, in order
  to use Distribute rather than Setuptools. By default, Setuptools
  is used.

Bugs fixed:

- While checking for new versions of setuptools and buildout itself,
  compare requirement locations instead of requirement objects.

- Incrementing didn't work properly when extending multiple files.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/421022

- The download API computed MD5 checksums of text files wrong on Windows.

1.4.1 (2009-08-27)
==================

New Feature:

- Added a debug built-in recipe to make writing some tests easier.

Bugs fixed:

- (introduced in 1.4.0) option incrementing (-=) and decrementing (-=)
  didn't work in the buildout section.
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/420463

- Option incrementing and decrementing didn't work for options
  specified on the command line.

- Scripts generated with relative-paths enabled couldn't be
  symbolically linked to other locations and still work.

- Scripts run using generated interpreters didn't have __file__ set correctly.

- The standard Python -m option didn't work for custom interpreters.

1.4.0 (2009-08-26)
==================

- When doing variable substitutions, you can omit the section name to
  refer to a variable in the same section (e.g. ${:foo}).

- When doing variable substitution, you can use the special option,
  ``_buildout_section_name_`` to get the section name.  This is most handy
  for getting the current section name (e.g. ${:_buildout_section_name_}).

- A new special option, ``<`` allows sections to be used as macros.

- Added annotate command for annotated sections. Displays sections
  key-value pairs along with the value origin.

- Added a download API that handles the download cache, offline mode etc and
  is meant to be reused by recipes.

- Used the download API to allow caching of base configurations (specified by
  the buildout section's 'extends' option).

1.3.1 (2009-08-12)
==================

- Bug fixed: extras were ignored in some cases when versions were specified.

1.3.0 (2009-06-22)
==================

- Better Windows compatibility in test infrastructure.

- Now the bootstrap.py has an optional --version argument,
  that can be used to force zc.buildout version to use.

- ``zc.buildout.testing.buildoutSetUp`` installs a new handler in the
  python root logging facility. This handler is now removed during
  tear down as it might disturb other packages reusing buildout's
  testing infrastructure.

- fixed usage of 'relative_paths' keyword parameter on Windows

- Added an unload entry point for extensions.

- Fixed bug: when the relative paths option was used, relative paths
  could be inserted into sys.path if a relative path was used to run
  the generated script.

1.2.1 (2009-03-18)
==================

- Refactored generation of relative egg paths to generate simpler code.

1.2.0 (2009-03-17)
==================

- Added a relative_paths option to zc.buildout.easy_install.script to
  generate egg paths relative to the script they're used in.

1.1.2 (2009-03-16)
==================

- Added Python 2.6 support. Removed Python 2.3 support.

- Fixed remaining deprecation warnings under Python 2.6, both when running
  our tests and when using the package.

- Switched from using os.popen* to subprocess.Popen, to avoid a deprecation
  warning in Python 2.6.  See:

  http://docs.python.org/library/subprocess.html#replacing-os-popen-os-popen2-os-popen3

- Made sure the 'redo_pyc' function and the doctest checkers work with Python
  executable paths containing spaces.

- Expand shell patterns when processing the list of paths in `develop`, e.g::

    [buildout]
    develop = ./local-checkouts/*

- Conditionally import and use hashlib.md5 when it's available instead
  of md5 module, which is deprecated in Python 2.6.

- Added Jython support for bootstrap, development bootstrap
  and zc.buildout support on Jython

- Fixed a bug that would cause buildout to break while computing a
  directory hash if it found a broken symlink (Launchpad #250573)

1.1.1 (2008-07-28)
==================

- Fixed a bug that caused buildouts to fail when variable
  substitutions are used to name standard directories, as in::

    [buildout]
    eggs-directory = ${buildout:directory}/develop-eggs

1.1.0 (2008-07-19)
==================

- Added a buildout-level unzip option tp change the default policy for
  unzipping zip-safe eggs.

- Tracebacks are now printed for internal errors (as opposed to user
  errors) even without the -D option.

- pyc and pyo files are regenerated for installed eggs so that the
  stored path in code objects matches the the install location.

1.0.6 (2008-06-13)
==================

- Manually reverted the changeset for the fix for
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/239212 to verify thet the test
  actually fails with the changeset:
  http://svn.zope.org/zc.buildout/trunk/src/zc/buildout/buildout.py?rev=87309&r1=87277&r2=87309
  Thanks tarek for pointing this out. (seletz)

- fixed the test for the += -= syntax in buildout.txt as the test
  was actually wronng. The original implementation did a split/join
  on whitespace, and later on that was corrected to respect the original
  EOL setting, the test was not updated, though. (seletz)

- added a test to verify against https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/239212
  in allowhosts.txt (seletz)

- further fixes for """AttributeError: Buildout instance has no
  attribute '_logger'""" by providing reasonable defaults
  within the Buildout constructor (related to the new 'allow-hosts' option)
  (patch by Gottfried Ganssauge) (ajung)


1.0.5 (2008-06-10)
==================

- Fixed wrong split when using the += and -= syntax (mustapha)

1.0.4 (2008-06-10)
==================

- Added the `allow-hosts` option (tarek)

- Quote the 'executable' argument when trying to detect the python
  version using popen4. (sidnei)

- Quote the 'spec' argument, as in the case of installing an egg from
  the buildout-cache, if the filename contains spaces it would fail (sidnei)

- Extended configuration syntax to allow -= and += operators (malthe, mustapha).

1.0.3 (2008-06-01)
==================

- fix for """AttributeError: Buildout instance has no attribute '_logger'"""
  by providing reasonable defaults within the Buildout constructor.
  (patch by Gottfried Ganssauge) (ajung)

1.0.2 (2008-05-13)
==================

- More fixes for Windows. A quoted sh-bang is now used on Windows to make the
  .exe files work with a Python executable in 'program files'.

- Added "-t <timeout_in_seconds>" option for specifying the socket timeout.
  (ajung)

1.0.1 (2008-04-02)
==================

- Made easy_install.py's _get_version accept non-final releases of Python,
  like 2.4.4c0. (hannosch)

- Applied various patches for Windows (patch by Gottfried Ganssauge). (ajung)

- Applied patch fixing rmtree issues on Windows (patch by
  Gottfried Ganssauge).  (ajung)

1.0.0 (2008-01-13)
==================

- Added a French translation of the buildout tutorial.

1.0.0b31 (2007-11-01)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added a configuration option that allows buildouts to ignore
  dependency_links metadata specified in setup. By default
  dependency_links in setup are used in addition to buildout specified
  find-links. This can make it hard to control where eggs come
  from. Here's how to tell buildout to ignore URLs in
  dependency_links::

    [buildout]
    use-dependency-links = false

  By default use-dependency-links is true, which matches the behavior
  of previous versions of buildout.

- Added a configuration option that causes buildout to error if a
  version is picked. This is a nice safety belt when fixing all
  versions is intended, especially when creating releases.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- 151820: Develop failed if the setup.py script imported modules in
  the distribution directory.

- Verbose logging of the develop command was omitting detailed
  output.

- The setup command wasn't documented.

- The setup command failed if run in a directory without specifying a
  configuration file.

- The setup command raised a stupid exception if run without arguments.

- When using a local find links or index, distributions weren't copied
  to the download cache.

- When installing from source releases, a version specification (via a
  buildout versions section) for setuptools was ignored when deciding
  which setuptools to use to build an egg from the source release.

1.0.0b30 (2007-08-20)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Changed the default policy back to what it was to avoid breakage in
  existing buildouts.  Use::

    [buildout]
    prefer-final = true

  to get the new policy.  The new policy will go into effect in
  buildout 2.

1.0.0b29 (2007-08-20)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Now, final distributions are prefered over non-final versions.  If
  both final and non-final versions satisfy a requirement, then the
  final version will be used even if it is older.  The normal way to
  override this for specific packages is to specifically require a
  non-final version, either specifically or via a lower bound.

- There is a buildout prefer-final version that can be used with a
  value of "false"::

    prefer-final = false

  To prefer newer versions, regardless of whether or not they are
  final, buildout-wide.

- The new simple Python index, http://cheeseshop.python.org/simple, is
  used as the default index.  This will provide better performance
  than the human package index interface,
  http://pypi.python.org/pypi. More importantly, it lists hidden
  distributions, so buildouts with fixed distribution versions will be
  able to find old distributions even if the distributions have been
  hidden in the human PyPI interface.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- 126441: Look for default.cfg in the right place on Windows.

1.0.0b28 (2007-07-05)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- When requiring a specific version, buildout looked for new versions
  even if that single version was already installed.

1.0.0b27 (2007-06-20)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Scripts were generated incorrectly on Windows.  This included the
  buildout script itself, making buildout completely unusable.

1.0.0b26 (2007-06-19)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Thanks to recent fixes in setuptools, I was able to change buildout
  to use find-link and index information when searching extensions.

  Sadly, this work, especially the timing, was motivated my the need
  to use alternate indexes due to performance problems in the cheese
  shop (http://www.python.org/pypi/).  I really home we can address
  these performance problems soon.

1.0.0b25 (2007-05-31)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- buildout now changes to the buildout directory before running recipe
  install and update methods.

- Added a new init command for creating a new buildout. This creates
  an empty configuration file and then bootstraps.

- Except when using the new init command, it is now an error to run
  buildout without a configuration file.

- In verbose mode, when adding distributions to fulful requirements of
  already-added distributions, we now show why the new distributions
  are being added.

- Changed the logging format to exclude the logger name for the
  zc.buildout logger.  This reduces noise in the output.

- Clean up lots of messages, adding missing periods and adding quotes around
  requirement strings and file paths.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- 114614: Buildouts could take a very long time if there were
  dependency problems in large sets of pathologically interdependent
  packages.

- 59270: Buggy recipes can cause failures in later recipes via chdir

- 61890: file:// urls don't seem to work in find-links

  setuptools requires that file urls that point to directories must
  end in a "/".  Added a workaround.

- 75607: buildout should not run if it creates an empty buildout.cfg

1.0.0b24 (2007-05-09)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Improved error reporting by showing which packages require other
  packages that can't be found or that cause version conflicts.

- Added an API for use by recipe writers to clean up created files
  when recipe errors occur.

- Log installed scripts.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- 92891: bootstrap crashes with recipe option in buildout section.

- 113085: Buildout exited with a zero exist status when internal errors
  occurred.


1.0.0b23 (2007-03-19)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added support for download caches.  A buildout can specify a cache
  for distribution downloads.  The cache can be shared among buildouts
  to reduce network access and to support creating source
  distributions for applications allowing install without network
  access.

- Log scripts created, as suggested in:
  https://bugs.launchpad.net/zc.buildout/+bug/71353

Bugs Fixed
----------

- It wasn't possible to give options on the command line for sections
  not defined in a configuration file.

1.0.0b22 (2007-03-15)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Improved error reporting and debugging support:

  - Added "logical tracebacks" that show functionally what the buildout
    was doing when an error occurs.  Don't show a Python traceback
    unless the -D option is used.

  - Added a -D option that causes the buildout to print a traceback and
    start the pdb post-mortem debugger when an error occurs.

  - Warnings are printed for unused options in the buildout section and
    installed-part sections.  This should make it easier to catch option
    misspellings.

- Changed the way the installed database (.installed.cfg) is handled
  to avoid database corruption when a user breaks out of a buildout
  with control-c.

- Don't save an installed database if there are no installed parts or
  develop egg links.

1.0.0b21 (2007-03-06)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added support for repeatable buildouts by allowing egg versions to
  be specified in a versions section.

- The easy_install module install and build functions now accept a
  versions argument that supplied to mapping from project name to
  version numbers.  This can be used to fix version numbers for
  required distributions and their depenencies.

  When a version isn't fixed, using either a versions option or using
  a fixed version number in a requirement, then a debug log message is
  emitted indicating the version picked.  This is useful for setting
  versions options.

  A default_versions function can be used to set a default value for
  this option.

- Adjusted the output for verbosity levels.  Using a single -v option
  no longer causes voluminous setuptools output.  Uisng -vv and -vvv
  now triggers extra setuptools output.

- Added a remove testing helper function that removes files or directories.

1.0.0b20 (2007-02-08)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added a buildout newest option, to control whether the newest
  distributions should be sought to meet requirements.  This might
  also provide a hint to recipes that don't deal with
  distributions. For example, a recipe that manages subversion
  checkouts might not update a checkout if newest is set to "false".

- Added a *newest* keyword parameter to the
  zc.buildout.easy_install.install and zc.buildout.easy_install.build
  functions to control whether the newest distributions that meed
  given requirements should be sought.  If a false value is provided
  for this parameter and already installed eggs meet the given
  requirements, then no attempt will be made to search for newer
  distributions.

- The recipe-testing support setUp function now adds the name
  *buildout* to the test namespace with a value that is the path to
  the buildout script in the sample buildout.  This allows tests to
  use

    >>> print system(buildout),

  rather than:

    >>> print system(join('bin', 'buildout')),


Bugs Fixed
----------

- Paths returned from update methods replaced lists of installed files
  rather than augmenting them.

1.0.0b19 (2007-01-24)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Explicitly specifying a Python executable failed if the output of
  running Python with the -V option included a 2-digit (rather than a
  3-digit) version number.

1.0.0b18 (2007-01-22)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added documentation for some previously undocumented features of the
  easy_install APIs.

- By popular demand, added a -o command-line option that is a short
  hand for the assignment buildout:offline=true.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- When deciding whether recipe develop eggs had changed, buildout
  incorrectly considered files in .svn and CVS directories.

1.0.0b17 (2006-12-07)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Configuration files can now be loaded from URLs.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- https://bugs.launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/71246

  Buildout extensions installed as eggs couldn't be loaded in offline
  mode.


1.0.0b16 (2006-12-07)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- A new command-line argument, -U, suppresses reading user defaults.

- You can now suppress use of an installed-part database
  (e.g. .installed.cfg) by sprifying an empty value for the buildout
  installed option.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- When the install command is used with a list of parts, only
  those parts are supposed to be installed, but the buildout was also
  building parts that those parts depended on.

1.0.0b15 (2006-12-06)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Uninstall recipes weren't loaded correctly in cases where
  no parts in the (new) configuration used the recipe egg.

1.0.0b14 (2006-12-05)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added uninstall recipes for dealing with complex uninstallation
  scenarios.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Automatic upgrades weren't performed on Windows due to a bug that
  caused buildout to incorrectly determine that it wasn't running
  locally in a buildout.

- Fixed some spurious test failures on Windows.

1.0.0b13 (2006-12-04)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Variable substitutions now reflect option data written by recipes.

- A part referenced by a part in a parts list is now added to the parts
  list before the referencing part.  This means that you can omit
  parts from the parts list if they are referenced by other parts.

- Added a develop function to the easy_install module to aid in
  creating develop eggs with custom build_ext options.

- The build and develop functions in the easy_install module now
  return the path of the egg or egg link created.

- Removed the limitation that parts named in the install command can
  only name configured parts.

- Removed support ConfigParser-style variable substitutions
  (e.g. %(foo)s). Only the string-template style of variable
  (e.g. ${section:option}) substitutions will be supported.
  Supporting both violates "there's only one way to do it".

- Deprecated the buildout-section extendedBy option.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- We treat setuptools as a dependency of any distribution that
  (declares that it) uses namespace packages, whether it declares
  setuptools as a dependency or not.  This wasn't working for eggs
  intalled by virtue of being dependencies.


1.0.0b12 (2006-10-24)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Added an initialization argument to the
  zc.buildout.easy_install.scripts function to include initialization
  code in generated scripts.

1.0.0b11 (2006-10-24)
=====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

`67737 <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/67737>`_
     Verbose and quite output options caused errors when the
     develop buildout option was used to create develop eggs.

`67871 <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/67871>`_
     Installation failed if the source was a (local) unzipped
     egg.

`67873 <https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/67873>`_
     There was an error in producing an error message when part names
     passed to the install command weren't included in the
     configuration.

1.0.0b10 (2006-10-16)
=====================

Feature Changes
---------------

- Renamed the runsetup command to setup. (The old name still works.)

- Added a recipe update method. Now install is only called when a part
  is installed for the first time, or after an uninstall. Otherwise,
  update is called.  For backward compatibility, recipes that don't
  define update methiods are still supported.

- If a distribution defines namespace packages but fails to declare
  setuptools as one of its dependencies, we now treat setuptools as an
  implicit dependency.  We generate a warning if the distribution
  is a develop egg.

- You can now create develop eggs for setup scripts that don't use setuptools.

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Egg links weren't removed when corresponding entries were removed
  from develop sections.

- Running a non-local buildout command (one not installed in the
  buildout) ket to a hang if there were new versions of zc.buildout or
  setuptools were available.  Now we issue a warning and don't
  upgrade.

- When installing zip-safe eggs from local directories, the eggs were
  moved, rather than copied, removing them from the source directory.

1.0.0b9 (2006-10-02)
====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

Non-zip-safe eggs were not unzipped when they were installed.

1.0.0b8 (2006-10-01)
====================

Bugs Fixed
----------

- Installing source distributions failed when using alternate Python
  versions (depending on the versions of Python used.)

- Installing eggs wasn't handled as efficiently as possible due to a
  bug in egg URL parsing.

- Fixed a bug in runsetup that caused setup scripts that introspected
  __file__ to fail.

1.0.0b7
=======

Added a documented testing framework for use by recipes. Refactored
the buildout tests to use it.

Added a runsetup command run a setup script.  This is handy if, like
me, you don't install setuptools in your system Python.

1.0.0b6
=======

Fixed https://launchpad.net/products/zc.buildout/+bug/60582
Use of extension options caused bootstrapping to fail if the eggs
directory didn't already exist.  We no longer use extensions for
bootstrapping.  There really isn't any reason to anyway.


1.0.0b5
=======

Refactored to do more work in buildout and less work in easy_install.
This makes things go a little faster, makes errors a little easier to
handle, and allows extensions (like the sftp extension) to influence
more of the process. This was done to fix a problem in using the sftp
support.

1.0.0b4
=======

- Added an **experimental** extensions mechanism, mainly to support
  adding sftp support to buildouts that need it.

- Fixed buildout self-updating on Windows.

1.0.0b3
=======

- Added a help option (-h, --help)

- Increased the default level of verbosity.

- Buildouts now automatically update themselves to new versions of
  zc.buildout and setuptools.

- Added Windows support.

- Added a recipe API for generating user errors.

- No-longer generate a py_zc.buildout script.

- Fixed some bugs in variable substitutions.

  The characters "-", "." and " ", weren't allowed in section or
  option names.

  Substitutions with invalid names were ignored, which caused
  missleading failures downstream.

- Improved error handling.  No longer show tracebacks for user errors.

- Now require a recipe option (and therefore a section) for every part.

- Expanded the easy_install module API to:

  - Allow extra paths to be provided

  - Specify explicit entry points

  - Specify entry-point arguments

1.0.0b2
=======

Added support for specifying some build_ext options when installing eggs
from source distributions.

1.0.0b1
=======

- Changed the bootstrapping code to only install setuptools and
  zc.buildout. The bootstrap code no-longer runs the buildout itself.
  This was to fix a bug that caused parts to be recreated
  unnecessarily because the recipe signature in the initial buildout
  reflected temporary locations for setuptools and zc.buildout.

- Now create a minimal setup.py if it doesn't exist and issue a
  warning that it is being created.

- Fixed bug in saving installed configuration data.  %'s and extra
  spaces weren't quoted.

1.0.0a1
=======

Initial public version
