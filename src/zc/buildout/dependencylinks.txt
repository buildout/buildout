Dependency links
----------------

By default buildout will obey the setuptools dependency_links metadata
when it looks for dependencies. This behavior can be controlled with
the use-dependency-links buildout option.

  [buildout]
  ...
  use-dependency-links = false

The option defaults to true. If you set it to false, then dependency
links are only looked for in the locations specified by find-links.

Let's see this feature in action.  To begin, let's create a new egg
repository. This repository uses the same sample eggs as the normal
testing repository.

    >>> link_server2 = start_server(sample_eggs)

Turn on logging on this server so that we can see when eggs are pulled
from it.

    >>> get(link_server2 + 'enable_server_logging')
    GET 200 /enable_server_logging
    ''

Let's create a develop egg in our buildout that specifies
dependency_links which point to the new server.

    >>> mkdir(sample_buildout, 'depdemo')
    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'depdemo', 'dependencydemo.py',
    ...       'import eggrecipedemoneeded')
    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'depdemo', 'setup.py',
    ... '''from setuptools import setup; setup(
    ...     name='depdemo', py_modules=['dependencydemo'],
    ...     install_requires = 'demoneeded',
    ...     dependency_links = ['%s'],
    ...     zip_safe=True, version='1')
    ... ''' % link_server2)

Now let's configure the buildout to use the develop egg.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... '''
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = depdemo
    ... parts = eggs
    ...
    ... [eggs]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:eggs
    ... eggs = depdemo
    ... ''')

Now we can run the buildout.

    >>> print system(buildout)
    GET 200 /
    GET 200 /demoneeded-1.2c1.zip
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/depdemo'
    Installing eggs.
    Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    Got demoneeded 1.2c1.
    <BLANKLINE>

Notice that the egg was retrieved from the logging server.

Now let's change the egg so that it doesn't specify dependency links.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'depdemo', 'setup.py',
    ... '''from setuptools import setup; setup(
    ...     name='depdemo', py_modules=['dependencydemo'],
    ...     install_requires = 'demoneeded',
    ...     zip_safe=True, version='1')
    ... ''')

Now we'll remove the existing dependency egg, and rerunning the
buildout to see where the egg comes from this time.

    >>> from glob import glob
    >>> from os.path import join
    >>> def remove_demoneeded_egg():
    ...     for egg in glob(join(sample_buildout, 'eggs', 'demoneeded*.egg')):
    ...         remove(sample_buildout, 'eggs', egg)
    >>> remove_demoneeded_egg()
    >>> print system(buildout) # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/depdemo'
    ...
    Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    While:
      Updating eggs.
      Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    Error: Couldn't find a distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    <BLANKLINE>

Now it can't find the dependency since neither the buildout
configuration nor setup specifies where to look.

Let's change things so that the buildout configuration specifies where
to look for eggs.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... '''
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = depdemo
    ... parts = eggs
    ... find-links = %s
    ...
    ... [eggs]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:eggs
    ... eggs = depdemo
    ... ''' % link_server)

    >>> print system(buildout)
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/depdemo'
    Installing eggs.
    Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    Got demoneeded 1.2c1.
    <BLANKLINE>

This time the dependency egg was found on the server without logging
configured.

Now let's change things once again so that both buildout and setup
specify different places to look for the dependency egg.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'depdemo', 'setup.py',
    ... '''from setuptools import setup; setup(
    ...     name='depdemo', py_modules=['dependencydemo'],
    ...     install_requires = 'demoneeded',
    ...     dependency_links = ['%s'],
    ...     zip_safe=True, version='1')
    ... '''  % link_server2)

    >>> remove_demoneeded_egg()
    >>> print system(buildout) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    GET 200 /...
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/depdemo'
    Updating eggs.
    Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    Got demoneeded 1.2c1.
    <BLANKLINE>

So when both setuptools and buildout specify places to search for
eggs, the dependency_links takes precedence over find-links.

There is a buildout option that you can specify to change this
behavior. It is the use-dependency-links option. This option defaults
to true. When you specify false for this option, buildout will ignore
dependency_links and only look for eggs using find-links.

Here is an example of using this option to disable dependency_links.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... '''
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = depdemo
    ... parts = eggs
    ... find-links = %s
    ... use-dependency-links = false
    ...
    ... [eggs]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:eggs
    ... eggs = depdemo
    ... ''' % link_server)

    >>> remove_demoneeded_egg()
    >>> print system(buildout)
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/depdemo'
    Updating eggs.
    Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    Got demoneeded 1.2c1.
    <BLANKLINE>

Notice that this time the egg isn't downloaded from the logging server.

If we set the option to true, things return to the way they were
before. The dependency's are looked for first in the logging server.

    >>> write(sample_buildout, 'buildout.cfg',
    ... '''
    ... [buildout]
    ... develop = depdemo
    ... parts = eggs
    ... find-links = %s
    ... use-dependency-links = true
    ...
    ... [eggs]
    ... recipe = zc.recipe.egg:eggs
    ... eggs = depdemo
    ... ''' % link_server)
    >>> remove_demoneeded_egg()
    >>> print system(buildout) #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    GET 200 /...
    Develop: '/sample-buildout/depdemo'
    Updating eggs.
    Getting distribution for 'demoneeded'.
    Got demoneeded 1.2c1.
    <BLANKLINE>
