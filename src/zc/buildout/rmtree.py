    A variant of shutil.rmtree which tries hard to be successful.
    On windows shutil.rmtree aborts when it tries to delete a
    read only file or a file which is still handled by another
    process (e.g. antivirus scanner). This tries to chmod the
    file to writeable and retries 10 times before giving up.

    >>> from tempfile import mkdtemp

    Let's make a directory ...

    >>> d = mkdtemp()

    and make sure it is actually there

    >>> os.path.isdir (d)
    1

    Now create a file ...

    >>> foo = os.path.join (d, 'foo')
    >>> with open (foo, 'w') as f: _ = f.write ('huhu')

    and make it unwriteable

    >>> os.chmod (foo, 256) # 0400

    rmtree should be able to remove it:

    >>> rmtree (d)

    and now the directory is gone

    >>> os.path.isdir (d)
    0
