Fix development installs to still work when using setuptools 80.0.0.
From then on, setuptools internally calls ``pip install --editable``.
It works until and including setuptools 80.2.0.
Later versions have other problems.
Note that "distutils scripts" can no longer be detected with setuptools 80.
This seems an ancient technology, and probably hardly used.
