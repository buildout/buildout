Require at least ``setuptools`` version 61.0.0.
This is needed due to the changes in the test setup.
According to semantic versioning, updating a dependency is not a breaking change, and does not require a major version bump.
It does seem significant here.  As a compromise, I mark this as a breaking change, and do a minor version bump.
