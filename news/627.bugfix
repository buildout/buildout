- Allow the ``-I`` option in the Python interpreter wrapper installed by
  buildout when using the ``zc.recipe.egg`` recipe's `interpreter =` directive.
  This solves the issue when VSCode calls the designated Python interpreter for
  a workspace with this option to determine the Python version etc.
