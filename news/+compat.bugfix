Disable ``patch_Distribution`` completely.
For a long time this patch did nothing, because of a typo.
When I fixed the typo, I would sometimes get errors during sorting of distributions, which was exactly what the patch was trying to solve, so it was breaking what it was trying to fix.
If you still run into ``TypeError: '<' not supported between instances of 'Version' and 'Version'``, try a different setuptools version.
